As a creator you now have access to your very own media library of NFTs that you create from now on! You should now see an option to `Upload` and `My Library`

# Upload

![Upload Mockup](https://creativeplatform.xyz/img/mockups/latest/upload.png)

1. Fill out this form and upload media per instructions.
2. Click `Save`.
    * This saves all of the metadata in your library without minting it into an NFT. So you can `edit` and `delete` this data prior to minting permanently onchain.

# My Library

1. Go to `My Library` under Wallet address menu.
2. Click `Fetch Library` to load all of you assests within your library.
    * From this page you can either submit to a Brand Campaign, edit, delete, or list your NFT for sale to various marketplaces (the choice is yours).

# Submit to Brand Campaign
You can submit to a brand campaign 2 ways.
1. `My Library`
2. Click a campaign from the homepage.
